# Todo Backend Test

## Intro

We are so excited that you are applying to be part of the edSpring team here at TIES!

This repo is designed for you to show us how you tackle these problems. Simply fork the repo, complete the tasks listed below and make a pull request with comments about your thought process.

>By submitting a pull request you are signifying that this is your own original work. Copying others work may disqualify you from continuing the interview process.

## Getting Started
On the edSpring team we use `Meteor` for our app architecture. You might not be familiar with it and that is ok. So here are some steps to get you started.

After cloning the repo locally, you can change to the app directory in the terminal and then run the `meteor` command. Once it is running you should be able to see the app running at localhost:3000 in your browser.

While this is running you can run the tests by opening another terminal window and running `meteor test --driver-package avital:mocha --port 3100`. This will allow you to open a browser and see any failing tests at localhost:3100.

## Tasks

### 1. Fixing tests

When you tests run you will notice that there are some that are failing. Use you awesome skills to pinpoint the failure and get it fixed so that we can get this app into production!

### 2. Fix the user sees private tasks bug (New feature?)

With the last release there was a request for users to be able to mark tasks private. As a new feature if a task is marked private only the task owner should be able to see it.

Please update the code so that only the user that owns a private task sees the task in the list of tasks.

### 3. Add your own improvements to the app

We have really enjoyed your work on this app and now we need to yo add your own little bit flare to it. Do as much or as little as you like. We are interested into the thought process behind you additions. Why did you make the changes that you did?
